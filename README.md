## From the task pdf

### Content Requirement

- The video must be about something from **your area of study**. For example, if I am studying
geology, I could create a video that describes the different shapes crystals form in. 

- For a master student, you do not have to describe your entire thesis in this video, but you could
explain an element of what you are doing or use the opportunity to present your research
question and why you feel it is important that it be investigated.

- **The video should be comprehensible by someone who is not at your level of understanding
in the subject**, i.e. it should be able to be understood by most people. 

### Format Requirements

- 1 minute (acceptable range is from 50 seconds to 1:05 minutes)
- Language must be English or Norwegian
- Subtitles are optional, but encourage for use after this course
- All images, icons, illustrations, photos, video clips, sounds and music that you did not
create yourself must be included in the credits at the end.
- File format must be .mp4, Inspera does not accept flash files
- Voice-over needs to be a real person talking, computer voice-overs will result in a
failing grade
